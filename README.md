Blacksheep MilSim Prototype Prop

Based off the project located at:
Arduino Bomb Pro - http://yin.mainstreamds.com/
Great Project and great guy! Well worth the look, the original project is fantastic and very usuable as is. However since our games are 24 hours non-stop we need to make some changes to the code and hardware to facitilitate our operations.

Original Project works with an Arudiono UNO, however this lacks the space and RAM needed for what I am trying to accomplish so this will be done on an Arduiono MEGA.

This is an Arduino project for a new prop for Blacksheep MilSim, with Domination, Search and destroy, and a bomb mode.  The plan will be to build this into a 50 cal ammo box. There will also be a hanging light to designate prop control using a NeoPixel strand of 133 LED lights.

You can see a test of my lighting display at:

So far my parts list:
   Arduino MEGA
   4x4 Matrix Keypad
   20x4 LCD
   I2C LCD controller
   NeoPixel Strand
   Various smaller components for power control.
